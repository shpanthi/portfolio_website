    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is [Your Name], and I am a passionate Agriculture graduate with a keen interest in sustainable agriculture. My journey in the field of agriculture has equipped me with a strong foundation in understanding the principles and practices that promote environmentally friendly farming techniques.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to my academic background, I have developed a robust skill set in data science. I am proficient in data analysis, visualization, and modeling using R, with extensive experience in leveraging powerful tools such as tidyverse, plotly, lme4, and caret. My ability to analyze complex datasets and present insights in a clear and actionable manner has been a significant asset in my work.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of my professional interests, I have a deep love for philosophy, which often provides me with a broader perspective on the world and our place within it. This philosophical mindset complements my scientific approach, allowing me to consider both ethical and practical implications of my work in sustainable agriculture.</p>
    
    <p>When I'm not immersed in my work, I enjoy playing football and volleyball. I am also an avid cricket fan, though I prefer watching the game rather than playing it. Additionally, I love traveling and exploring new places, which often provides me with fresh inspiration and insights into different agricultural practices around the world.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to connecting with you and exploring opportunities to contribute to sustainable agricultural initiatives.</p>

				<p> Because of the huge population growth and intensified modern chemical based agricultural practices the land and soil quality is degrading. </p>
				<p> To minimize the damage on soil, environment as well as innumerable other species including soil microbes we the shift towards organic and ecology   </p>
				<p> based agricultual practices. This is an urgent need as the land degradation and desertification is a very serious issue. </p>

				<p> Data Science including data analysis and visualization plays a key role in quick and easy understanding of the data we study. R (including base R and </p>
				<p> packages: ggplot2, dplyr, plotly, caret, lme4, tidyr etc) and python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc) provides a strong support for it.
